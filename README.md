# 🔫 Original TPS Kit (Open Source Release)

Welcome to the **Original TPS Kit**, now fully open-source and free for the Unreal Engine community. This kit was originally developed and distributed through Patreon, but it's time to pass the torch.

Whether you're building a third-person survival game, a zombie shooter, or experimenting with stealth and economy systems — this kit is a solid starting point.

> ⚠️ Please note: This is **not** the GASP version. It’s my original TPS Kit.
